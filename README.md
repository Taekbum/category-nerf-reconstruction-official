Our method reconstructs objects using category-level models. Objects belonging to the same category share common shape properties, which help to reconstruct unobserved parts plausibly. On the other hand, unobserved parts of objects that are reconstructed by the object-level model tend to be over-smooth or fail to recover complete geometry.
